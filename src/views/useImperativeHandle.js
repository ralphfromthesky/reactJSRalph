            Scenario: <br />
            In React, the forwardRef function allows a parent component to
            receive a ref from a child component. This is useful when you need
            to interact with the child component's DOM node or instance. <br />
            <br />
            Problem: <br />
            How can you customize the properties of the ref that the parent
            receives from the child? <br/><br/>Solution: <br/>useImperativeHandle allows you to
            selectively expose properties or methods of the child component's
            instance to the parent component's ref. Basic Usage:

        <Box>

          </Typography>
          <img src="image/useImpertativeHandle.png" />
          <br />
          <br />
          <Typography variant="h4" color="initial" component="p">
            Child Component:
          </Typography>

            Explanation: <br /> The useImperativeHandle hook is used within the child
            component to customize the properties/methods exposed to the parent
            ref.  <br />In this example, the child exposes a getInternalState method
            and a customMethod to the parent ref.  <br />The parent component uses the
            child component and its ref to access these exposed properties and
            methods. <br /> <br /> Key Points: <br />useImperativeHandle is used with forwardRef to
            customize the properties/methods exposed to the parent when using a
            child component. <br /> <br /> It's not about passing data from child to parent in
            a general sense but about exposing specific functionalities of the
            child to the parent.  <br /> <br />The hook takes two arguments: the ref and a
            callback function that returns an object representing the
            properties/methods to expose.  <br />It's useful when you want to control
            what parts of the child component are accessible to the parent
            through the ref.  <br /> <br />In simple terms, useImperativeHandle is a way to
            fine-tune the information that a parent component can access from
            its child component using a ref.
